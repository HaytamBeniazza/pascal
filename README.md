# Pascal Mini Project

A small Pascal project demonstrating basic programming concepts and math utilities.

## Files

- `main.pas` - A simple calculator program that handles basic arithmetic operations
- `mathutils.pas` - A unit containing utility math functions
- `mathapp.pas` - An application that uses the math utilities unit

## How to Run

This project can be compiled with Free Pascal Compiler (FPC) or Lazarus IDE.

### Using Free Pascal Compiler (FPC)

```
fpc main.pas
./main
```

```
fpc mathapp.pas
./mathapp
```

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Advanced math functions (power, factorial, prime checking)
- Modular code structure with separate unit
